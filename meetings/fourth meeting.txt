Participants: Fran, Sergey, Dasha, Misha, Grisha

Agenda:
    
     - Corpus of glosses
     - seq2seq model
     - Chukchi corpus
     - https://github.com/mpsilfve/ud-segmenter

Updates:
    
    - Corpus of glosses created!
       - Needs to go somwhere ->https://github.com/ftyers/nis-nplm/corpora
       - 1006 sentences / ~5k tokens
    - Corpus of Chukchi created!
       - Needs to go somwhere ->https://github.com/ftyers/nis-nplm/corpora
       - This is the first version, there are some sentences that could need to be split.
       - How many sentences / How many tokens ? 
       - Sentences: 33,331  Words: 150,180
    - Found a seq2seq model, trained it to train from Chukchi to glosses. 
       - Not using BPE.
       - It's not great, there is something wrong. If there is an unknown word, it will raise an error.
       - Tried to use BPE, used sentencepiece from Google on the extended corpus (from Sergey)
       - Need to adapt the model to use BPE.
       - BPE will be applied only on the source side (Chukchi words)
       - Can we get 3-5 sentences of output from the model ? 
    - UD segmenter works
       - https://github.com/OneAdder/ud-segmenter

      repr(morpheme) = s₁⊗ r₁ + ... + sₙ ⊗ rₙ

      m1 = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

      m2 = [0, 1, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0]

         morpheme1 = (s₁⊗ r₁ + ... + sₙ ⊗ rₙ)   ⊗ m1  
         morpheme2 = (s₁⊗ r₁ + ... + sₙ ⊗ rₙ)   ⊗ m2      
         word = repr(morpheme1) + repr(morpheme2)
         corpus2tensors.py = take a corpus and produce a lookup dictionary of morpheme -> tensor ?

         - Question:  "word = repr(morpheme1) + repr(morpheme2)" do we use the vectorised representation or the tensor representation ? 
              
Todo: 
        - Dasha: Write conversion script for gloss output of seq2seq to input for ud-segmenter
        - Greg: Get BPE model working and test on corpus, also we need word barriers! 
        - Sergey: Get some sentences with gold standard segmentation 25-100 sentences from the glossed corpus. Greg should not use those 100 sentences in training.
        - Misha: Run ud-segmenter on 150k corpus converted 
        - Fran: Ask Christo where the code is for the prediction.
